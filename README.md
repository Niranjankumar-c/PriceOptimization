# PriceOptimization

Pricing optimization is another valuable use for data scientists. 

# Background
Pricing is one of toughest challenges for most companies. 
To begin, there are different pricing methodologies depending on the industry, product, brand power, and so on. And to make things trickier, a product can command drastically different prices depending on the context. 
Let's take a bottle of water for example. For $2, you could buy a 6-pack of bottled water at a supermarket. However, those same $2 might only afford you one bottle at a movie theatre. 
As a result, companies will try to find the optimal price, that which maximizes earnings (a.k.a. "gross revenue"), for their market.
